               <h2>About Covid-19</h2>
               <p> 
               The new virus covid-19 also known as the Corona Virus, 
               is a pandemic that is making many panic. 
               While many may confuse it with the flu, 
               the main differences between them is that the covid-19 is deadlier than the flu and it also spreads quickly.
               However, similar to the flu, this virrus aims to compromise the immune system, and the ones affected most by this are the elderly and the youngest people.
               With the lockdown and panicking going on, many stores are running out of basic neccesities. While this has a 3% mortality rate, 
               which seems low, with the expected infection of about 70% of the world before the end of the year, 
               that is around 116 million deaths or about half of the US.
               The reason the lockdown is set in place is because it is the easiest way to prevent hospitals from being overcrowded, in addition it slows the spread because there is less contact between people.
               This virus likely won't be able to be solved without the collaboration of all countries.

                        <p> 
                        With the lockdown and the implementaion of this online school, 
                        I will probably do that school work and then play games and read up on the virus and miscellaneous things.
                        While I think that the virus is deadly and harmful for our country, the media overblows it a bit for people middle age and below.
                        For us kids, it will be something that just happens, but we should still be weary about spreading it to others where it could fatally harm them
